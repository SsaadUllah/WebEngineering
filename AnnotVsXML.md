Advantages of XML :
•	It is a simultaneously human- and machine-readable format.
•	XML is heavily used as a format for document storage and processing, both online and offline.
•	It is platform-independent, thus relatively immune to changes in technology.
•	It is based on international standards.

Disadvantages of XML :
•	XML namespaces are problematic to use and namespace support can be difficult to correctly implement in an XML parser.
•	XML syntax is redundant or large relative to binary representations of similar data.
•	XML is commonly depicted as “self-documenting” but this depiction ignores critical ambiguities.

Advantages of Annotations :
•	Static type checking - the compiler will check for you where the annotation (once defined properly) is applicable and how
•	Clean code - it's much easier to see (visually) the meta data defined in annotations.
•	Because annotations are Java code, there is no need to "switch" between writing Java and XML.
•	Using the IDE's "find references" feature, you can quickly see if the project is using a particular configuration attribute.
Disadvantages of Annotation :
Disadvantage of the is that you need to recompile the code if you do a little change in it.
